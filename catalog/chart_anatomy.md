# Elements of a chart
Most data visualizations are rectangular charts, with two dimensions represented on a vertical and a horizontal axis. Rectangular charts are typically constructed with a set of common elements including a title (sometimes also a subtitle), a legend and axis titles. In interactive visualizations charts may also include some navigation tools like a tooltip or a toolbar.

1. __Chart title__
The title of a visualization should be concise and descriptive and should reflect the insight the data reveals.
2. __Ticks__
3. __Axes__
The X-axis is horizontal and the Y-axis is vertical. Axes should be accessible against their background with a 3:1 contrast ratio.
4. __Axes titles__
5. __Legend__
Many charts will use different visual properties such as colors, textures, and shapes to represent different categories or dimensions of data. A legend tells you what these associations mean and helps you to determine the chart’s meaning.
6. __Tool bar__
7. __Graph frame__
The graph frame is the area where data will be visualized with graphics or numbers. Gridlines help a viewer estimate the values of a data point but are not required. Use gridlines sparingly, as too much visual noise makes the graph frame busy and negatively impacts the user’s ability to interpret the data.
8. __Tool tip__
A tooltip is a message that appears when a cursor is positioned over an element, such as a data point, icon button, or truncated text. By default, tooltips show on hover to reveal more detailed information or context for specific chart elements. A tooltip should repeat the corresponding values of the data point on both axes and any other relevant details.
