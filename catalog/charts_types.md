# Comparisons
## Bar chart
Bar charts use vertical or horizontal data markers to compare individual values. You can use them to compare discrete data or show trends over time.

```image

```
## Grouped bar chart
A grouped bar chart, also known as a clustered bar graph, multi-set bar chart, or grouped column chart, is a type of bar graph that is used to compare values across multiple categories.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "grouped_bar_discrete.png"
```

## Bubble chart
Bubble charts use data points and bubbles to plot measures anywhere along a scale. One measure is plotted along each axis. The size of the bubble represents the third measure. You can use bubble charts to represent financial data or any data where measured values are related.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "bubble_chart.png"
```

## Horizontal bar
Bar charts use vertical or horizontal data markers to compare individual values. You can use them to compare discrete data or show trends over time.

```image
plain: true

# Distributions
## Histogram
A histogram displays the frequency and distribution for a range of quantitative groups.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "histogram.png"
```

## Box-and-whisker
A box-and-whisker plot displays the distribution and shape of a series of quantitatives values for different categories. The display is formed by a combination of lines and point markers to indicate, typically, five different statistical measures.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "box-and-whisker.png"
```

# Trends
## Line chart
Line charts plot data at regular intervals connected by lines. You can use line visualizations to show trends over time and compare several data sets.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "line_discrete.png"
```

## Area chart
Area charts are similar to line charts, but the areas below the lines are filled with colors or patterns. Stacked charts are useful for comparing proportional contributions within a category. They plot the relative value that each data series contributes to the total.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "area_chart.png"
```

## Stream chart
A stream chart displays how quantitative values for different categories have changed over time.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "stream_chart.png"
```

# Part-to-whole
## Pie
A pie chart shows how quantities of different constituent categories make up a whole. It uses circular display divided ino sectors for each category, with the angle representing each of the percentage proportions.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "pie.png"
```
## Donut
A donut chart is a variation on a pie chart except it has a round hole in the center which makes it look like a donut, hence the name. This empty space can be used to display additional data.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "donut.png"
```

## Stacked bar
Stacked bar charts are useful for comparing proportional contributions within a category. They plot the relative value that each data series contributes to the total.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "stacked_bar_discrete.png"
```

## Stacked area
Stacked area charts are useful for comparing proportional contributions within a category. They plot the relative value that each data series contributes to the total

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "stacked_area_chart.png"
```

## Tree map
A tree map is an enclosure diagram providing a hierarchical display to show how the quantities of different constituent parts make up a whole.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "treemap.png"
```

# Correlations
## Scatter plots
Scatter plot visualizations use data points to plot two measures anywhere along a scale, not only at regular tick marks. You can use scatter plots to explore correlations between different measures.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "scatter_plot_discrete.png"
```

## Heatmap
A heat map is a graphical representation of data where individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "heatmap.png"
```

# Connections
## Alluvial diagram
Alluvial diagrams are a type of flow diagram that represents changes in network structure over time.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "alluvial_diagram.png"
```

## Tree diagram
A tree diagram visually represents a hierarchy in a tree-like structure.

# Geospatial (overlays)
## Choropleth map
A choropleth map uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placement of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "choropleth_map.png"
```

## Proportional symbol
Symbols driven by data are overlayed in geographical regions. A common symbol used is a bubble with the area of the circle proportional to its value in the dataset.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "proportional_symbol.png"
```

## Connecting lines
Connection maps display points on a map connected by straight or curved lines. Connection maps are most useful when showing connections and relationships geographically. They can also be used to display map routes through a single chain of links.

```image
plain: true
span: 4
src: "connecting_lines.png"
```
