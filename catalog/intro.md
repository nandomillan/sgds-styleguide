This is a living style guide created by Fernando Millan Villalobos. 

# About this documentation
This style guide is meant to serve as a first attempt to set up a design system as a tool to capture, collect and share design patterns and guidelines for their usage in the context of the SG BSc Data ScienceÂ´s data visualization competence. Adhering to these guidelines leads to a more consistent presentation of design work in all the competences and projects where data visualization plays a relevant role. The inspiration for this project and a considerable part of its content, has directly or indirectly [the NZZ Visuals Style guide](https://nzzdev.github.io/Storytelling-Styleguide/#/) as primary source and manual.

When we talk about patterns, we refer to any repeating, reusable parts of the interface that can be applied and repurposed to solve a specific design problem. Creating this kind of library is an example of a (good) design practice. Traditionally, a style guide focuses on styles, such as colors and typography. In our work, this notion that comes mainly from graphic design has been adjusted to meet the specifics needs of data visualization.

 With this in mind, a design system can be defined as a:

* Shared language that everyone on a team uses to refer to objects. If everyone within a team uses the same word to describe the same thing, so much organizational fogginess goes away. 
* Shared design resources to quickly create mockups that accurately reflect our design system.
* Shared code components that allows everyone to build these components and their variations, often with just copy-paste.
