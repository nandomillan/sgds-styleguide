Rectangular charts are typically constructed with a set of common elements including a title (sometimes also a subtitle), a legend and axis titles. In interactive visualizations charts may also include some navigation tools like a tooltip or a toolbar.\r\n\r\n```image\r\nplain: true\r\nspan: 4\r\nsrc: "chart_anatomy_modif.png"\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. __Chart title__\r\nThe title of a visualization should be concise and descriptive and should reflect the insight the data reveals.\r\n2. __Ticks__\r\n3. __Axes__\r\nThe X-axis is horizontal and the Y-axis is vertical. Axes should be accessible against their background with a 3:1 contrast ratio.\r\n4. __Axes titles__\r\n5. __Legend__\r\nMany charts will use different visual properties such as colors, textures, and shapes to represent different categories or dimensions of data. A legend tells you what these associations mean and helps you to determine the chart\u2019s meaning.\r\n6. __Tool bar__\r\n7. __Graph frame__\r\nThe graph frame is the area where data will be visualized with graphics or numbers. Gridlines help a viewer estimate the values of a data point but are not required. Use gridlines sparingly, as too much visual noise makes the graph frame busy and negatively impacts the user\u2019s ability to interpret the data.\r\n8. __Tool tip__\r\nA tooltip is a message that appears when a cursor is positioned over an element, such as a data point, icon button, or truncated text. By default, tooltips show on hover to reveal more detailed information or context for specific chart elements. A tooltip should repeat the corresponding values of the data point on both axes and any other relevant details.'}});
