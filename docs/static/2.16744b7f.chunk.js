A huge chunk of our brains is devoted to gathering, filtering, processing, organizing, and interpreting data collected from the retinas at the back of our eyes. We\xb4ve evolved to be really fast at detecting visual patterns and exceptions to those patterns. It is only natural, that a set of methods consisting of mapping data into visual properties would prove to be so powerful." [\\[1\\]](#references)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of visualizations, whether they serve as a means to communicate stories and research findings or as platform for data manipulation and exploration, can be considered a cognitive artefacts. Thus most of the design patterns used to build data visualizations are established and familiar. They make use of people\u2019s mental models and allow design to be understood intuitively. This cognitive perspective can be translated directly into design thinking looking at the common elements of visualizations.\r\n\r\nAny visualization comprises five layers of design: [\\[2\\]](#references)\r\n\r\n* __Data representation:__ Which chart type is used and what data will be included in the chosen chart.\r\n* __Annotation:__ Determining which patterns in the data should be emphasized to the viewer.\r\n* __Color:__ One of the key applications of colour is how to emphasize content and direct the eye.\r\n* __Composition:__ This concerns all of the physical layout, shape and size decisions.\r\n* __Interactivity:__ The role of interactivity is to enable adjustments to what data is displayed and how it is displayed.\r\n\r\nIn our case, our design system follows these principles based on layers as a tool for representing a whole set of things that we want to feel like a coherent family that works in all sorts of different contexts.\r\n\r\n# Audience\r\nThis style guide was conceived since the very first moment as a self-guide to make smoother and quicker building data visualizations in the context of the data science studies and to gather a more solid understanding of the different elements involved in the process of conveying visual information.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n[1]: A.
