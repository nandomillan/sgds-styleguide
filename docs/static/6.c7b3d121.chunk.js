[\\[1\\]](#references) Data visualization is one of the key components to effectively display data based on its pictorial or graphical presentation. The primary goal of data visualization is about helping people to better comprehend information.\r\n\r\n# Table of contents\r\n- [Introduction](#introduction)\r\n  * [Truthful](#truthful)\r\n  * [Functional](#functional)\r\n  * [Beautiful](#beautiful)\r\n  * [Insightful](#insightful)\r\n  * [Enlightening](#enlightening)\r\n- [References](#references)\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\nCharts, also called visualizations, are based on a grammar, a vocabulary of symbols, and plenty of conventions. [\\[2\\]](#references) They make use of the extraordinary capability of our brains to register information at-a-glance to serve us as vehicle to convey complex data information in an effective way. With this in mind, by transforming complex numbers as integrated visual patterns would certainly allow us to form \u201cmental models,\u201d in which would help us remember the graphics we see. The display of information varies depending on what kind of graphs are presented, and things to consider are: length, height, position, area, hue or shade. These attributes will determine how numerical data will be displayed. To effectively communicate data, it is important to balance the design with smart use of patterns. It will help viewers to tap into their natural analytic abilities.\r\n\r\nWe\xb4ll take Prof. Cairo\xb4s guidance regarding how good visualizations [\\[3\\]](#references) should be built to let them lead our data visualization process. According to him, a persuasive and effective visualization (or chart) has certain qualities:\r\n\r\n1. It is __truthful__ , as it\u2019s based on thorough and honest research. \r\n2. It is __functional__ , as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it\u2019s built in a way that lets people do meaningful operations based on it (seeing change in time). \r\n3. It is __beautiful__ , in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience. \r\n4. It is __insightful__ , as it reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise. \r\n5. It is __enlightening__ because if we grasp and accept the evidence it depicts, it will change our minds for the better.\r\n\r\n## Truthful\r\n* Get used to not just seeing or looking at visualizations but to reading them.\r\n* Avoid self-deception. We humans evolved to see patterns in meaningless noise. We jump to conclusions. We see causality where there\u2019s only correlation. Truthful graphics are created by people who do their best to prevail over their intellectual shortcomings and cognitive and ideological biases by applying certain critical thinking techniques.\r\n* Be honest with your audience. Show them your best understanding of what the reality is. Or, to use the words of Carl Bernstein, one of the reporters who broke the Watergate story in the 1970s, we should strive to pursue and deliver \u201cthe best obtainable version of the truth.\u201d\r\n* To make a truthful graphic, you also need to pay attention to its functions or purposes.\r\n\r\n## Functional\r\n* You begin with raw matter, you think of a purpose it can be used for, and then you shape it in a way that enables people to achieve that purpose.\r\n* If you need to read all of the numbers in a chart to understand it, why do you need the chart in the first place?\r\n* The purpose of your graphics should somehow guide your decision of how to shape the information.\r\n\t\r\n## Beautiful\r\n* Always have in mind what the feeling of beauty means: the way we perceive the appearance of an object and its deep connection to its purpose.\r\n* What matters isn\u2019t if the objects of our creation are beautiful or not per se, but if they are experienced as beautiful by as many people as possible.\r\n* Beauty matters because attractive and pleasing things work better. They put us in a good mood, and so they invite us to invest some effort in understanding how to operate them.\r\n* Data visualization isn\u2019t the same as data decoration.\r\n* Personal aesthetic preferences can play a role in visualization, and not all design choices that are unrelated to the data can be deemed as useless.\r\n\t\r\n## Insightful\r\n* The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures.\r\n* There are two related kinds of insights: spontaneous insight, which is equivalent to a \u201ceureka\u201d or \u201ca-ha\u201d moment and knowledge-building insight, which is based on a gradual and deliberate process of exploration of the information. Knowledge-building insight is much more common in interactive visualizations.\r\n\t\r\n## Enlightening\r\n* An enlightening graphic is a consequence of paying attention to the previous four qualities.\r\n* Choosing topics ethically and wisely matters a lot. Some topics do matter more than others indeed because they are more critical to the well-being of more people.\r\n* We should certainly do good with data, but only after we\u2019ve thoroughly made sure that our data is good.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n[1]: A.
