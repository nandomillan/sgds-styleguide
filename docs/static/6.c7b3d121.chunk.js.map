The display of information varies depending on what kind of graphs are presented, and things to consider are: length, height, position, area, hue or shade.

According to him, a persuasive and effective visualization (or chart) has certain qualities:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. It is __truthful__ , as it’s based on thorough and honest research. \\r\\n2. It is __functional__ , as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it’s built in a way that lets people do meaningful operations based on it (seeing change in time). \\r\\n3. It is __beautiful__ , in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience. \\r\\n4. It is __insightful__ , as it reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise. \\r\\n5. It is __enlightening__ because if we grasp and accept the evidence it depicts, it will change our minds for the better.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Truthful\\r\\n* Get used to not just seeing or looking at visualizations but to reading them.\\r\\n* Avoid self-deception. We humans evolved to see patterns in meaningless noise. We jump to conclusions. We see causality where there’s only correlation. Truthful graphics are created by people who do their best to prevail over their intellectual shortcomings and cognitive and ideological biases by applying certain critical thinking techniques.\\r\\n* Be honest with your audience. Show them your best understanding of what the reality is. Or, to use the words of Carl Bernstein, one of the reporters who broke the Watergate story in the 1970s, we should strive to pursue and deliver “the best obtainable version of the truth.”\\r\\n* To make a truthful graphic, you also need to pay attention to its functions or purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Functional\\r\\n* You begin with raw matter, you think of a purpose it can be used for, and then you shape it in a way that enables people to achieve that purpose.\\r\\n* If you need to read all of the numbers in a chart to understand it, why do you need the chart in the first place?\\r\\n* The purpose of your graphics should somehow guide your decision of how to shape the information.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n## Beautiful\\r\\n* Always have in mind what the feeling of beauty means: the way we perceive the appearance of an object and its deep connection to its purpose.\\r\\n* What matters isn’t if the objects of our creation are beautiful or not per se, but if they are experienced as beautiful by as many people as possible.\\r\\n* Beauty matters because attractive and pleasing things work better.
